# Threshold Definition

* This code will be added at a later date. *

Summary:

The staircase procedure involved determining the threshold current and voltage for each stimulation electrode by initially applying 2mA and adjusting in increments or decrements based on participant responses ("yes" or "no") to feeling the stimulation. The step size are 1mA, 0.5mA, 0.25mA, and 0.1mA through successive stimulations.
